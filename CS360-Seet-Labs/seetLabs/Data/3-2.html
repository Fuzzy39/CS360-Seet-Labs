	<h1>Writing and Calling Methods</h1>
	<p>You've learned how to define methods with parameters and return values, how to call those methods, and even how to overload and use recursion. In this challenge, you're going to write three different methods: one that adds two integers, one that multiplies two doubles, and one recursive method that returns the factorial of a number. Then, use each method and return a formatted string showing their results.</p>
