# Seet Labs

I was in my office, trying to keep the many projects on my plate in motion, when an unfamiliar young man walked in. 

"Excuse me sir, Mr. Seet would like to have a word with you." The boy tried his best to maintain his facade of proffesionalism, but he seemed nervous nontheless.

"Mr. Seet?" I asked. He was very important to the labs, only second to the CEO. I wasn't sure what he did, exactly, but he was, by all accounts, a very busy man. 

"Y-Yes, he'd like to speak with you immediately." The young man, presumably an intern, nodded sheepishly.

I stood up, and he led me to an elevator. One that was sort of out of the way, that I had personally never used before. We got in, and he put a key in the door panel, revealing several buttons that were normally entirely hidden. One was simply labeled 'Seet'.
Did the enigmatic Mr. Seet have an entire floor to himself? what could possibly be the reason for that?
The elevator went down. The intern avoided any eye contact. He sighed deeply.

"Is everything alright?" I asked. 

"Oh- quite. Don't worry about me." He nervously chuckled.

The elvator ride took quite a while. Longer than felt reasonable. The lab must have several undergound floors that I wasn't even aware of. That alone was disconserting.
Before I had too long to stew in my thoughts, the elevator stopped. The intern led me down a few halways, until we found a sliding glass door labeled 'Mr. Seet - Visitors entrance' Through the door appeared to be another elevator.

"This is as far as I can take you." The boy said, his voice nearly wavering. "Simply go down the elevator to meet Mr. Seet. Try not to take up too much of his time."

"Uh. Alright. Thanks." I entered the automatic doors, and pressed the button for the elevator. There was a bit of waiting, then a pnuematic hiss. The doors didn't open however. The air became foggy, and I suddenly felt... tired.

Only a few months ago, I had never heard of Mr. Seet or his company. I first came across the listing for an open position in the office on one of those job sites. I can't remember which one exactly: I had looked in some admittedly strange places for anyone who would hire me. I do remember the slight sense of... unease? that came over me the moment I clicked on the listing. I felt suddenly like I was being looked at. Not "watched" so much as someone somewhere suddenly Knew about me. Even so, I decided to close my windows and check that the front door of my little apartment was locked before I went back to my computer.

That feeling really didn't go away over the next few weeks. The interviewing process was pretty strange too: all kinds of strange questions bordering on personal interrogation. A less desparate person might have called them some kind of violation, but I honestly really needed the job. I could overlook a couple nosy HR people- it's nothing I hadn't experienced before. But still, their insistence on knowing some of the strangest details was startling. The moment I sat down for my final interview, their first question was "Do you believe there's a god?". Nothing about prior work experience or my personal skills... and to be frank I'm kinda glad they didn't ask those kind of questions. No, they wanted to hear my thoughs about the nature of God. Best I could tell them was "if there is a God, I've never met him!" My attempt at humor didn't seem too funny to that hiring manager- blank stares in return, then a quick note on whatever paper she was hiding from me.

Why did I accept the position then? Well like I've said, I was kinda desparate. The pay was... decent. And the benefits were good, surprisingly good. They gave me an offer I was in no position to refuse. And so here I am.

I eventually became more used to that feeling of strange exposure since starting the job. They gave me a little office on one of the higher floors of the building. Only one small window, but it's better than nothing; although I did choose to keep the blinds on that window closed almost all the time. But there were plenty of other things to put my mind to. No matter how much I could push away that feeling of being looked at, there was one thing that always brought my mind back into the awareness of it: my new boss's name. Mr. Seet. I feel a little strange even saying it now. But It's unavoidable that you have to say your boss's name pretty regularly in an office like this. It's at the top of internal letters, included on emails, and of course he signs for my paychecks.

The thing that was strange though is that it seemed like very few people in the office had met Mr. Seet in person more than a few times. After all, everyone said, "Mr. Seet is a very busy man." And the way my coworkers talk about those few times they have met him... well they just mention a time they entered his office and everyone else kinda nods knowingly. But I wasn't one of the ones who knew what he's really like, and I kept that to myself. I think everyone could tell despite my secrecy.
