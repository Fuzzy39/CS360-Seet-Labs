# Seet Labs

I was in my office, trying to keep the many projects on my plate in motion, when an unfamiliar young man walked in. 

"Excuse me sir, Mr. Seet would like to have a word with you." The boy tried his best to maintain his facade of proffesionalism, but he seemed nervous nontheless.

"Mr. Seet?" I asked. He was very important to the labs, only second to the CEO. I wasn't sure what he did, exactly, but he was, by all accounts, a very busy man. 

"Y-Yes, he'd like to speak with you immediately." The young man, presumably an intern, nodded sheepishly.

I stood up, and he led me to an elevator. One that was sort of out of the way, that I had personally never used before. We got in, and he put a key in the door panel, revealing several buttons that were normally entirely hidden. One was simply labeled 'Seet'.
Did the enigmatic Mr. Seet have an entire floor to himself? what could possibly be the reason for that?
The elevator went down. The intern avoided any eye contact. He sighed deeply.

"Is everything alright?" I asked. 

"Oh- quite. Don't worry about me." He nervously chuckled.

The elvator ride took quite a while. Longer than felt reasonable. The lab must have several undergound floors that I wasn't even aware of. That alone was disconserting.
Before I had too long to stew in my thoughts, the elevator stopped. The intern led me down a few halways, until we found a sliding glass door labeled 'Mr. Seet - Visitors entrance' Through the door appeared to be another elevator.

"This is as far as I can take you." The boy said, his voice nearly wavering. "Simply go down the elevator to meet Mr. Seet. Try not to take up too much of his time."

"Uh. Alright. Thanks." I entered the automatic doors, and pressed the button for the elevator. There was a bit of waiting, then a pnuematic hiss. The doors didn't open however. The air became foggy, and I suddenly felt... tired.
