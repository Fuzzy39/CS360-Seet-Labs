                "3p" : "There are several ways to instantiate an array. One way is done in the same line as the array is declared and requires all the values to be known beforehand. To do this, use curly braces and separate the entries with commas:%cint[] myArray = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9};%/cThis creates an array with the same size as the number of entries listed.%nAnother way allows the size of the array to be set without populating the array. To do this, use the %knew%/k keyword and again use the type of value followed by square brackets. This time, put the length of the array (the number of entries it should store) inside the brackets. It should look like this: %cint[] myArray = new int[10];%/cIn this case, myArray can store 10 integer values.",

The second value therefore has an index of 1, and so on. To access a value from an array by index, use square brackets with the index inside:%cmyArray[0];%/cIn this example, the first entry will be retrieved.",

This is also a way to get the last element in an array:%cmyArray[myArray.length - 1];%/cAlso note that the index of the last item is %klength - 1%/k, again because of zero-indexing. If you try to access an index which is outside the array, an %kIndexOutOfBoundsException%/k will be thrown."
