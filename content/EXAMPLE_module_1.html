    <title>Arrays</title>
    <h1>What is an Array?</h1>
    <p>Arrays are a simple way to store several pieces of data. They allow fast random access through indexing. Any primitive type or object can be held in an array. Arrays have a length and are <i>immutable</i>, which means that their size cannot be changed.</p>
    <h1>Declaring an Array</h1>
    <p>Arrays can be created by first declaring the type of value in the array, followed by square brackets <b>[]</b>, then the name of the array:</p>
    <p class="code-block">int[] myArray</p>
    <p>Aternately, place the square brackets after the array name:
    <p class="code-block">int myArray[]</p>
    <p>In these cases, the array is named <b>myArray</b> and can store <b>integers</b>.</p>
    <h1>Instantiating an Array</h1>
    <p>There are several ways to instantiate an array. One way is done in the same line as the array is declared and requires all the values to be known beforehand. To do this, use curly braces and separate the entries with commas:</p>
    <p class="code-block">int[] myArray = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9};</p>
    <p>This creates an array with the same size as the number of entries listed.<br>Another way allows the size of the array to be set without populating the array. To do this, use the <b>new</b> keyword and again use the type of value followed by square brackets. This time, put the length of the array (the number of entries it should store) inside the brackets. It should look like this:</p>
    <p class="code-block">int[] myArray = new int[10];</p>
    <p>In this case, myArray can store 10 integer values.</p>
