	<title>Arrays</title>
	<h1>What is an Array?</h1>
	<p>Arrays are a simple way to store several pieces of data. They allow fast random access through indexing. Any primitive type or object can be held in an array. Arrays have a length and are <i>immutable</i> which means that their size cannot be changed.</p>
	<h1>Declaring an Array</h1>
	<p>Arrays can be created by first declaring the type of value in the array followed by square brackets [] then the name of the array:</p>
	<div class="code-block"><pre>int[] myArray</pre></div>
	<p>Aternately place the square brackets after the array name:</p>
	<div class="code-block"><pre>int myArray[]</pre></div>
	<p>In these cases the array is named myArray and can store integers.</p>
	<h1>Instantiating an Array</h1>
	<p>There are several ways to instantiate an array. One way is done in the same line as the array is declared and requires all the values to be known beforehand. To do this use curly braces and separate the entries with commas:</p>
	<div class="code-block"><pre>int[] myArray = {1 3 5 7 9};</pre></div>
	<p>This creates an array with the same size as the number of entries listed.<br>Another way allows the size of the array to be set without populating the array. To do this use the <b>new</b> keyword and again use the type of value followed by square brackets. This time put the length of the array (the number of entries it should store) inside the brackets. It should look like this: </p>
	<div class="code-block"><pre>int[] myArray = new int[10];</pre></div>
	<p>In this case myArray can store 10 integer values.</p>
	<h1>Accessing values in an Array</h1>
	<p>To access a value within an array use its <b>Index</b>. Arrays are zero-indexed which means that the first element in the array has an index of 0. The second value therefore has an index of 1 and so on. To access a value from an array by index use square brackets with the index inside:</p>
	<div class="code-block"><pre>myArray[0];</pre></div>
	<p>In this example the first entry will be retrieved.</p>
	<h1>Looping through an Array</h1>
	<p>Traversing arrays is an obvious use of loops. For example this is how to use a <b>for</b> loop to print all the values in an array:</p>
	<div class="code-block"><pre>for (int i = 0; i < myArray.length; i++) {<br>&#9;System.out.println(myArray[i]);<br>}</pre></div>
	<p>Notice the use of the <b>.length</b> property which returns the number of elements which can be held in the array. This is also a way to get the last element in an array:</p>
	<div class="code-block"><pre>myArray[myArray.length - 1];</pre></div>
	<p>Also note that the index of the last item is <b>length - 1</b> again because of zero-indexing. If you try to access an index which is outside the array an <b>IndexOutOfBoundsException</b> will be thrown.</p>
