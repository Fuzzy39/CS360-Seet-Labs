	<h2>Practice with Control Flow</h2>
	<p>You've learned how Java uses conditionals and loops to control the flow of a program. In this activity, we'll solve a classic coding problem called FizzBuzz. Use a <span class="keyword">for</span> or <span class="keyword">while</span> loop with a range from 0 to 100 (including 0 and 100). If the number is divisible by both 5 and 3, print "FizzBuzz". If it is divisible only by 5, print "Fizz". If divisible only by 3, print "Buzz". If divisible by neither, print the number itself. Make sure your output matches these instructions exactly. Use conditionals to implement this behavior.<br>&#10;HINT: To check if one number is a factor of another, use the modulo <span class="keyword">%</span> operator. <span class="keyword">X % Y == 0</span> is true if Y is a factor of X.</p>
