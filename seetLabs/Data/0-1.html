	<h1>What is Java?</h1>
	<p>That's easy. <b>Java</b> is a <b>Programming Language</b> designed to be "Write Once, Run Anywhere". This means you can write Java code on your laptop, and — like a well-trained pet — it will happily run on different devices without needing major changes. It's a <b>High-Level</b> language created by James Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystems in the mid-'90s, and it quickly became one of the most popular programming languages in the world. Whether you're building games, web apps, or software that controls a robot army (disclaimer: please use Java responsibly), Java has got you covered!</p>
	<h1>Why Use Java?</h1>
	<p>Out of all the programming languages in the world, why use Java? Well, because Java is like the Swiss Army Knife of programming! It's powerful, versitile, and won't judge you for forgetting a semicolon (well… maybe a little). Java is used for everything from phone apps to banking systems, and it's even been to space — that's right, NASA has chosen Java as their favored language for interactive, mission-critical software. Java is designed to be <b>secure, portable, and scalable,</b> meaning it plays well with others and can handle everything from tiny projects to massive enterprise applications. So whether you're coding for fun, profit, or world domination (again, please use Java responsibly), it's a fantastic language to have in your toolbox!</p>
	<h1>Setting up the JDK</h1>
	<p>Before you can start your Java adventure, you need to set up your JDK (Java Development Kit) — AKA, the magical toolbox that lets you write, compile, and run Java programs. Think of it as your wizard staff, but for coding.<br><b>STEP 1: Download the JDK</b><br>Head over to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">Oracle's official website "https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/"</a> or an open-source alternative like OpenJDK. Pick the right version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux) and download the installer.<br><b>STEP 2: Installation</b><br>Run the installer which you just downloaded, and follow the <i>next-next-finish</i> ritual. Pay attention to where it installs Java — you might need that later!<br><b>STEP 3: Set Up the Environment Variables</b><br>If you're on Windows, you may need to add Java to your PATH. This helps your computer find Java whenever you summon it from the command line. Search for <b>Environment Variables</b> in your system settings. Find <span class="keyword">Path</span> under System Variables and add the directory where Java was installed (usually something like <span class="keyword">C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk-XX.X.X\bin</span>).<br><b>STEP 4: Test Your Setup</b><br>Open a terminal or command prompt and type: <span class="keyword">java -version</span> If Java responds with a version number instead of a tantrum, then congratulations! You're ready to code!</p>
	<h1>A Simple Java Program</h1>
	<p>It's time to write your very first Java program! And, of course, we're going to start with the most legendary, time-honored tradition in programming: making the computer say <b>"Hello, World!"</b><br><b>STEP 1: Create a Java File</b> Open your favorite text editor (Notepad++, VS Code, IntelliJ, or even just Notepad) and create a new file called: <span class="keyword">HelloWorld.java</span>.<br><b>STEP 2: Write the Code</b>Type (or copy, we won't judge) the following Java code into your new file: </p>
	<pre><code class="language-java">public class HelloWorld{
	<br>public static void main(String[] args){
		<br>System.out.println("Hello, World!");
	<br>}
}</code></pre>
	<p><br><b>STEP 3: Compile the Code</b><br>Now, open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder where you saved <span class="keyword">HelloWorld.java</span> (use <span class="keyword">cd FOLDER_NAME</span> to find your folder). Then, type: <span class="keyword">javac HelloWorld.java</span>. If Java is feeling cooperative, this will create a file called <span class="keyword">HelloWorld.class</span>, which is the compiled version of your program.<br><b>STEP 4: Run the Program</b><br>Now it's time for the moment of truth! Run your program by typing: <span class="keyword">java HelloWorld</span>. If everything went well, you should see: <span class="keyword">Hello, World!</span> printed to the console. And just like that, you've made your computer talk! You're officially a Java programmer. Next step: world domination (or at least writing some more cool programs).</p>
	<h1>The Integrated Development Environment</h1>
	<p>While you could write Java code in a plain text editor like a true old-school hacker, most developers prefer something a little more… luxurious. Enter the <b>Integrated Development Environment</b> (or <b>IDE</b> if you don't have much time) — a fancy, feature-packed tool that makes coding easier, faster, and a lot less frustrating.<br>Some of the most popular Java IDEs include:<br><b>IntelliJ IDEA</b> — Sleek, powerful, and loved by professionals. (Also, it tries to autocomplete everything.)<br><b>Eclipse</b> — A veteran in the Java world, with tons of plugins and customizations.<br><b><br>NetBeans</b> — Great for beginners and packed with built-in tools.<br><b>VS Code</b> — With the right extensions, a popular pick which can handle Java like a champ.<br><b>Why use an IDE?</b>. An IDE does more than just let you type code, it enables <i>better</i> code with features like Syntax Highlighting (because black-and-white gets boring), Auto-Completion, Debugging Tools, and Built-in Compilers (which will save you from the terminal's fussiness). While we encourage you to set up an IDE on your own machine, SeetLabs: Code also provides you a built-in Java environment and compiler which you can access anytime in the Playground.</p>
