	<h1>Variables</h1>
	<p>If you've paid attention in your math classes, you've heard of variables. Variables are essentially names for some number, whether you know its value or not. In Java, variables are a little more complicated, but the basic idea is the same. Variables store some bit of data so we can use it throughout our program. The most important things to know about a variable are its <b>Name</b>, <b>Type</b>, and <b>Value</b>. Here's how we create a variable in Java: </p>
	<pre><code class="language-java">int myVar = 10;</code></pre>
	<p>There are a few things to notice here. The first keyword we use is <span class="keyword">int</span>, which tells Java what <i>kind</i> of variable we are making, in this case an <span class="keyword">integer</span>. Next, we give the variable a name, <span class="keyword">myVar</span> in this case, which can be anything we want so long as it starts with a letter ('A'-'Z' or 'a'-'z') or underscore ('_'). Finally, we give the variable a value. You'll notice that we use a regular, old equals sign <span class="keyword">=</span> for that, which is called the <b>Assignment Operator</b> (how fancy). We could have skipped this part for now, but we have to make sure to give our variable a value at some point before we actually use the it for anything. We could have done the same thing this way: </p>
	<pre><code class="language-java">int myVar;<br>// Some other code<br>myVar = 10;</code></pre>
	<p>The first line here is called <b>Declaration</b>, when we tell the compiler to create a place to store a value, while the last line is called <b>Instantiation</b>, when we tell our program to give the variable a value. Next, we'll talk some more about <b>Data Types</b>.</p>
	<h1>Primitive Types</h1>
	<p>Every variable in a Java program has a <b>Type</b>. This tells the Compiler how to treat a variable, how big it is, and what kind of <i>stuff</i> we can store in it. Some of these types are called <b>Primitive Types</b>, which doesn't mean they're any less useful than other types but does mean that they hold a pure, simple value of some kind. In Java, there are 8 primitive types:<br><span class="keyword">boolean</span> — Hold true or false and nothing in between. <span class="keyword">boolean likesPizza = true;</span><br><span class="keyword">byte</span> — Holds 8 ones or zeroes (bits) for a range of [-128, 127]. <span class="keyword">byte pizzasEaten = 100;</span><br><span class="keyword">char</span> — Holds a single character, like the keys on your keyboard (as well as a bunch of other interesting symbols). To mark a char, use single quotes (' ') around one letter or symbol. <span class="keyword">char lastNameInitial = 'L';</span><br><span class="keyword">short</span> — A 16-bit whole number with a range of [-32768, 32767]. <span class="keyword">short totalPizzas = 32000;</span><br><span class="keyword">int</span> — A very commonly-used datatype holding a whole number with a range in the billions. <span class="keyword">int MAX_PIZZAS = 1000000;</span><br><span class="keyword">long</span> — Holds a whole number value with double the size of an int and a range in the quintillions. <span class="keyword">long population2020 = 7_855_000_000L;</span><br><span class="keyword">float</span> — Holds a decimal value with 7 digits of precision. <span class="keyword">float pepperoniPercentage = 0.40f;</span><br><span class="keyword">double</span> — Another very common type which holds decimals with 15 digits of precision. <span class="keyword">double pizzaWeight = 2.5934;</span><br>All of these data types have their own use and applications, but <span class="keyword">boolean</span>, <span class="keyword">int</span>, and <span class="keyword">double</span> are the most commonly used primitive types.</p>
	<h1>Reference Types</h1>
	<p>As opposed to <b>Primitive Types</b>, <b>Reference Types</b> are not values themselves but rather point to a place in memory and tells the program where to find some other values, like how the number on your house tells people where to find it. Reference Types <i>refer</i> to <b>Objects</b> of which there are many, many varieties. Some of the most common are:<br><span class="keyword">String</span> — Holds a string of characters, like a sentence or a name. To create a string, use double quotation marks (" "). <span class="keyword">String pizzaType = "Cheese";</span><br><span class="keyword">Date</span> — This is used to store a specific point in time, given as a number of milliseconds since the beginning of the year 1970. <span class="keyword">Date birthday = new Date();</span><br><span class="keyword">List, Set, and Map</span> — These are Collections, which will be explored in a later chapter.<br><span class="keyword">Integer, Double, Boolean</span> — These are different from the primitive types we already talked about: notice the capital letters which mark these as <b>Wrapper Classes</b>. We'll explain these more later.<br>All of these types start with a capital letter and are made up of the primitive types we already discussed. They can also have certain <b>Methods</b> which define their behavior and interactions. For instance: </p>
	<pre><code class="language-java">String name = "Jimmy";<br>System.out.print(name.charAt(0)); // Prints 'J'</code></pre>
	<p>In this example, we create a String and then ask for the first character inside that string. Here's an example of another type of Reference Type:</p>
	<pre><code class="language-java">Date myDate = new Date(0);<br>System.out.print(myDate.getTime()); // Prints "0"</code></pre>
	<p>In this case, we create a Date Object using the <span class="keyword">new</span> keyword, and give it a value of 0. Then, we print that same value using the <span class="keyword">.getTime()</span> method. All Objects have a set of defined variables (also called fields, attributes, or members), as well as a set of operations (also called methods, functions, or behaviors). One very important reference value is <span class="keyword">null</span>, which is a reserved keyword representing the absence of a value or reference. We can set any reference value to null, but attempting to use that reference will result in an error:</p>
	<pre><code class="language-java">Date date = null;<br>System.out.print(date.toString()); // ERROR!</code></pre>
	<p></p>
	<h1>Type Conversion and Casting</h1>
	<p>Sometimes, you might need to change the type of a variable, or to use its value as a different type. When using Objects which provide an easy way to do this, the process is simple. For instance, we might want to turn a String into an int:<i>nt myInt = Integer.parseInt("100");</i> This will instantiate myInt with a value of 100. However, how can we turn a int into a double, and vice versa? This is called <b>Casting</b>, and can be performed in several ways. One type of type conversion is <b>implicit casting</b>, in which the compiler will automatically <b>widen</b> certain values into values with a greater range, size, or precision: </p>
	<pre><code class="language-java">int intValue = 10;<br>double doubleValue = intValue; // doubleValue is 10.0</code></pre>
	<p>In this case, the int is <i>widened</i> into a double. This works for float -> double, int -> long, short -> float, etc. Another type of type conversion is called <b>explicit casting</b> and must be used when performing <b>narrowing</b>, or turning a value into a value with a lesser size, range, or precision:</p>
	<pre><code class="language-java">double doubleValue = 10.99;<br>int intValue = (int) doubleValue; // intValue is 10</code></pre>
	<p>The decimal value of the double will be <b>chopped</b> or <b>truncated</b> and lost, not rounded.</p>
	<h1>Constants</h1>
	<p>There are many reasons you might want to create a <b>Constant Variable</b>, the value of which will never change. For instance, many important mathematical values are constants, like π, e, or φ. In Java, we can make a constant using the <span class="keyword">final</span> keyword:</p>
	<pre><code class="language-java">final double PI = 3.141592653589793;</code></pre>
	<p>Once set, the value of a <span class="keyword">final</span> variable cannot be changed, which means that you <i>must</i> initialize the variable on the same line as it is declared. Constants are accessed just like any other variable inside your programs. It is convention to name <span class="keyword">final</span> variables with capital letters, with words separated by underscores.</p>
	<h1>Other Attributes of a Variable</h1>
	<p>While we've already discussed the most important attributes of a variable, there are many more ways to describe a variable than just its type, name, and value. These include: <b>Scope</b>, or the area of code in which a variable can be accessed; <b>Mutability</b>, or whether a variable's value can be changed (remember constants); <b>Visibility</b>, which describes what classes may access a variable (like public, private, and protected); <b>Location</b>, which we discussed with Reference Variables; and <b>Lifespan</b>, which is closely linked to scope and describes the period during which a variable exists (like local and static). All of these describe when, how, and where a variable may be set, modified, and accessed.</p>
