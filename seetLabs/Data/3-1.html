	<title>Methods and Subprograms</title>
	<h1>Defining and Calling</h1>
	<p><b>Methods</b> (which can be called <b>Functions</b> in many cases) are named blocks of code designed to perform specific tasks. These are one of the most important elements to writing clean programs: creating and using methods will help with organization, reusability, and debugging. In Java, you declare a method by specifying its <b>return type</b>, <b>name</b>, and <b>parameters</b>. This line is called the <b>Method header</b>. Some examples are: </p>
	<pre><code class="language-java">public int add(int a, int b) { ... }</code></pre>
	<p></p>
	<pre><code class="language-java">public void greet() { ... }</code></pre>
	<p>public static void main(String[] args) { ... }ยง561</p>
	<h1>Method Returns and Parameters</h1>
	<p>Methods can <b>return values</b> and accept <b>parameters</b> to handle different inputs. Defining the return type is the purpose of including a type name in the method header. We can use any type here, or no type at all, in which case we write <span class="keyword">void</span> to mark that the function returns no values.<br>Parameters, meanwhile, are the pieces of data which we can give (or pass) to our function. Parameters are listed in the peretheses after the method name, identified by their type and the name you want them to have inside the method. All the values passed to the function are Copied or Duplicated, so changing them inside the method body <b>does not affect</b> the variables you called the function with. Here's an example: </p>
	<pre><code class="language-java">public int add(int a, int b) {<br>&#9;return a + b;<br>}</code></pre>
	<p> Here, <span class="keyword">add</span> takes two <b>int</b> parameters, which we name 'a' and 'b', adds them together, and returns the sum. The return type <b>int</b> indicates the method yields an integer result. To <b>call</b> (or <b>invoke</b>) this method, we use its name followed by the necessary parameters inside parenthases. Using the <span class="keyword">sum</span> method as an example, we could do this: </p>
	<pre><code class="language-java">int x = sum(10, 8);</code></pre>
	<p> Once the method returns a value, it will be assigned to x. To call a method with no parameters, use empty parentheses, like this: </p>
	<pre><code class="language-java">greet();</code></pre>
	<p> This will call greet. Note that you can only <b>access</b> a method inside its <b>scope</b>, which is what words like <span class="keyword">public</span> and <span class="keyword">private</span> identify. <span class="keyword">public</span> means a method can be accessed anywhere, while <span class="keyword">private</span> means that the method can only be used <b>inside the same class</b>. We'll talk more about why this is important in the section on classes.</p>
	<h1>Overloading</h1>
	<p><b>Overloading</b> lets you define multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists. Based on the arguments you call a method with (their number or types), Java chooses the correct method to invoke. Here's an example:</p>
	<pre><code class="language-java">public void display(int num) {<br>&#9;System.out.println(num);<br>}<br>public void display(String message) {<br>&#9;System.out.println(message);<br>}</code></pre>
	<p> Both methods are named <span class="keyword">display</span>, yet Java distinguishes them by their parameter types. Calling <span class="keyword">display</span> with an <span class="keyword">int</span> value will invoke the first, while calling the same method with a <span class="keyword">String</span> value invokes the second: </p>
	<pre><code class="language-java">display(3); // calls display(int num)<br>display("Hi!"); // calls display(String message)</code></pre>
	<p></p>
	<h1>Pass-by-Value vs Pass-by-Reference</h1>
	<p>Java uses <b>pass-by-value</b> for all method arguments. This means a copy of the variable's value is passed. For primitive types, the value itself is copied. For objects, the reference is copied, so methods can modify object state but cannot reassign the original reference. Example:</p>
	<pre><code class="language-java">public void updateValue(int num) {<br>&#9;num = 100; // only the copy changes<br>}<br><br>public void updateObject(MyClass obj) {<br>&#9;obj.value = 100; // modifies the actual object's value field<br>}</code></pre>
	<p> We'll explore the implications of this some more in the module on Classes.</p>
	<h1>The Call Stack</h1>
	<p>While Java is running, it manages all the methods and variables you use by placing them in something called the <b>Stack</b>. Imagine a stack of pancakes: from the top of the pile, you can either add a new pancake or grab one to eat. When something is pushed (added) to the stack, it goes on top. When something is removed (popped), it is removed from the top. At the bottom of our stack goes the <b>Main Method</b>. Every time we call a method, a new <b>frame</b> is created and pushed. Once that method returns, the frame is popped and destroyed. Here's something new: what happens if we call one method, say <span class="keyword">int B()</span> inside another method, called <span class="keyword">int A()</span>, which itself is called from <span class="keyword">main</span>? In this case, <span class="keyword">main</span> stays at the bottom of our stack, <span class="keyword">A()</span> is placed on top, and then <span class="keyword">B()</span> is put on top of <span class="keyword">A()</span>. When each method returns (or ends), control will pass back to the topmost method on the stack. When <span class="keyword">main</span> returns (or ends), the program is done.</p>
	<h1>Recursion</h1>
	<p><b>Recursion</b> occurs when a method calls itself to solve a smaller instance of the same problem. Have you ever seen those nesting dolls that can be put inside each other? That could be called an example of recursion. In Java, recursion is as easy as invoking a method inside itself. A clear <b>base case</b> is essential: this is a condition on which recursion should stop and no further calls should be made. Here's an example which finds the factorial of a number:</p>
	<pre><code class="language-java">public int factorial(int n) {<br>&#9;if (n <= 1) {<br>&#9;&#9;return 1; // base case<br>&#9;}<br>}</code></pre>
	<p> Without the base case, the calls would continue indefinitely, and we'd eventually run out of memory space without returning anything useful (don't worry if this happens- the memory manager will reclaim everything once execution stops). After the base case, we define a <b>recursive case</b>. This is the condition when another call should be made. Let's add this to our <span class="keyword">factorial</span> method: </p>
	<pre><code class="language-java">public int factorial(int n) {<br>&#9;if (n <= 1) {<br>&#9;&#9;return 1; // base case<br>&#9;}<br>&#9;else {<br>&#9;&#9;return n * factorial(n - 1);<br>&#9;}<br>}</code></pre>
	<p> As long as <span class="keyword">n</span> is larger than 1, factorial will call itself recursively. Once <span class="keyword">n</span> reaches 1, the function will start returning, all the way down the chain until the very first function returns with our factorial value. There are many problems that can be solved this way, by defining a base case and a recursive case.</p>
	<h1>Best Practices</h1>
	<p>- Keep methods focused: each should do one task.<br>- Choose descriptive names: <span class="keyword">greetUser()</span> is clearer than <span class="keyword">method1()</span>.<br>- Limit parameters: if you need many, consider grouping them into an object.<br>- Document non-obvious behavior with comments.<br>- Write small helper methods to simplify complex logic.</p>
