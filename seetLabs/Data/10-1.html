	<h1>Final Review: Key Java Concepts</h1>
	<h2>Core Syntax and Control Flow</h2>
	<p>We began with Java's foundational syntax: variables, data types, operators, and control flow. You learned how to use conditional statements (<span class="keyword">if</span>, <span class="keyword">switch</span>) and loops (<span class="keyword">for</span>, <span class="keyword">while</span>) to control execution. Understanding scope and the flow of logic in methods sets the stage for structured programming.</p>
	<h2>Methods, Parameters, and Recursion</h2>
	<p>You explored defining and calling methods, passing arguments, returning values, and the importance of the call stack. Recursion was introduced as a powerful technique for solving problems that can be broken into smaller subproblems, such as calculating factorials or navigating trees.</p>
	<h2>Object-Oriented Programming</h2>
	<p>OOP is central to Java. You studied classes, objects, encapsulation, and the use of constructors and instance variables. Key principles—inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction—enable code reuse and modular design. You also learned to override methods, use the <span class="keyword">super</span> keyword, and work with the Object base class.</p>
	<h2>Interfaces, Abstract Classes, and Design</h2>
	<p>Interfaces and abstract classes were compared as ways to enforce structure in code while enabling flexibility. Design tips encouraged favoring composition over inheritance, using polymorphism for extensibility, and structuring code with clear contracts and reuse in mind.</p>
	<h2>Exception Handling</h2>
	<p>Java's robust error handling involves <span class="keyword">try</span>, <span class="keyword">catch</span>, <span class="keyword">finally</span>, and the use of <span class="keyword">throw</span> and <span class="keyword">throws</span>. You practiced catching specific exceptions, declaring methods that can throw checked exceptions, and using custom exception classes. Try-with-resources ensures clean file or stream handling.</p>
	<h2>Input and Output</h2>
	<p>You learned console input via <span class="keyword">Scanner</span>, character and byte stream handling, file reading/writing with <span class="keyword">BufferedReader</span> and <span class="keyword">FileWriter</span>, and object serialization with <span class="keyword">ObjectOutputStream</span>. We emphasized best practices for exception-safe I/O, character encoding, and NIO.2 utilities.</p>
	<h2>Arrays and Collections</h2>
	<p>Arrays provided fixed-size storage with direct indexing, while collections (like <span class="keyword">ArrayList</span>, <span class="keyword">HashSet</span>, and <span class="keyword">HashMap</span>) offered dynamic, flexible alternatives. You practiced iterating with <span class="keyword">for-each</span> loops and <span class="keyword">Iterator</span>, using <span class="keyword">Collections</span> and <span class="keyword">Arrays</span> utility classes, and choosing the right structure for your data.</p>
	<h2>Advanced Structures and Generics</h2>
	<p>You tackled stacks, queues, deques, trees, and compared <span class="keyword">LinkedList</span> and <span class="keyword">ArrayList</span>. Generics enabled you to write type-safe, reusable code with wildcards and bounded parameters. You built generic classes and methods to handle a variety of types with a single implementation.</p>
	<h2>Putting It All Together</h2>
	<p>By combining these topics, you're prepared to design robust, maintainable, and scalable Java programs. From handling user input to managing complex data with generics, you've seen how Java supports clean, efficient software development.</p>
