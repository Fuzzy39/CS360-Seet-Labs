	<h1>Practicing OOP: Inheritance and Interfaces</h1>
	<p>In this activity, you're going to write a small hierarchy of classes to demonstrate your understanding of inheritance, interfaces, and method overriding. You'll define an interface called <span class="keyword">Animal</span>, an abstract class called <span class="keyword">Mammal</span> that implements the interface, and two concrete classes: <span class="keyword">Dog</span> and <span class="keyword">Cat</span>. Each class should have its own implementation of the <span class="keyword">makeSound()</span> method. Finally, write a method called <span class="keyword">runTests()</span> that creates a <span class="keyword">Dog</span> and a <span class="keyword">Cat</span> and returns their sounds concatenated together.</p>
