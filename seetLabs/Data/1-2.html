	<h1>Working with Variables and Types</h1>
	<p>You've learned how to declare variables, assign values, and work with different primitive and reference types in Java. Now let's put it all together! In this activity, you'll define and use several variables of various types. Use at least one variable of each of the following types and values: <span class="keyword">int</span> with a value of 100, <span class="keyword">double</span> with a value of 20.0, <span class="keyword">char</span> with a value of 'J', <span class="keyword">boolean</span> with a value of true, and <span class="keyword">String</span> with a value of "Hello". Make sure your values match the ones here exactly. Finally, print out each of those values in the same order you created them using <span class="keyword">System.out.println()</span>.</p>
